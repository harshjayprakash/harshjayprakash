## Hello, I'm Harsh.

I'm a developer drawn to the quiet craft of programming.

### What I'm working on

- `harshjayprakash.github.io`: (v4006.x) Refining the documentation.
- `experimental-blok`: (v1005.x) Redefing doxy documentation.
- `*`: Improving README, and unifying screenshots.

### The process

- Trello boards mirror phase progression through a kanban rhythm - from "Inbox", "Deferred" to "Archived:{version}".
- [Epoch Semantic Versioning](https://antfu.me/posts/epoch-semver) encodes lifecycle milestones; each `main` push marks a new turn.
- Documentation is modular and discoverable source, with development history for deeper exploration. (*Work in Progress*)
