## Hello, I'm Harsh.

I'm a developer drawn to the quiet craft of programming.

* I have a degree in Computer Science from The University of Winchester (2024).
* I'm currently looking for experience/job in the industry.

### What I'm working on

- `algorithmic-art-playground`: Re-constructing.
- `experimental-blok`, `harshjayprakash.github.io`: Working on Wikis for some projects.
- Improving READMEs.
- Unifying screenshots and figures.

### The process

- Trello Boards - Kanban-style tracking for development and progressive logging.
- [Epoch Semantic Version](https://antfu.me/posts/epoch-semver) - Milestone-based versiooning.
- Documentation - Treating every README, wiki, and changelog as a system.
- Internal Codenames (Alchemical Materials) - Each codename acts as a signature for a milestone or epoch.

### The philosophy

- Software should feel quiet. Clear, scalable, and unobstrusive.
- Every artefact, from code to documentation, is part of a system.
- Modularity is not just technical. It is cognitive. It helps with clear thinking.
